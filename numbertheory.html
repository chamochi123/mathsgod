      <h2>Divisibility</h2>
      <p>Divisibility is a fundamental concept in number theory.</p>
      <p>An integer a is said to be divisible by an integer b if there exists an integer c such that a = bc.</p>
      <p>For example, 12 is divisible by 3 because 12 = 3 Ã— 4.</p>

      <h2>Prime Numbers</h2>
      <p>A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1.</p>
      <p>For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers.</p>
      <p>Prime numbers play a crucial role in number theory and have numerous applications in cryptography and other fields.</p>
