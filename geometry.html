      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Geometry is the study of shapes and their properties.</p>
      <p>It is a fundamental area of mathematics that has numerous applications in art, architecture, engineering, and other fields.</p>

      <h2>Points, Lines, and Planes</h2>
      <p>A point is a location in space.</p>
      <p>A line is a set of points that extend infinitely in two directions.</p>
      <p>A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions.</p>

      <h2>Angles and Measurements</h2>
      <p>An angle is a measure of the amount of rotation between two lines or planes.</p>
      <p>Angles can be measured in degrees, radians, or gradians.</p>
<p>For example, the angle between two lines can be measured using a protractor.</p>

<h2>Properties of Shapes</h2>
<p>A shape is a self-contained area with a defined boundary.</p>
<p>Examples of shapes include triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, circles, and 3D objects such as pyramids and spheres.</p>
<p>Each shape has its own unique properties, such as the number of sides, the number of angles, and the type of symmetry.</p>
