<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Calculus is the study of continuous change.</p>
<p>It is a fundamental area of mathematics that has numerous applications in science, engineering, economics, and other fields.</p>

<h2>Limits and Continuity</h2>
<p>A limit is the value that a function approaches as the input gets arbitrarily close to a certain point.</p>
<p>Continuity is the property of a function being continuous at a point, meaning that the function can be drawn without lifting the pencil from the paper.</p>

<h2>Differentiation</h2>
<p>Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function.</p>
<p>The derivative represents the rate of change of the function with respect to the input.</p>

<section>
<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>Integration is the process of finding the integral of a function.</p>
<p>The integral represents the accumulation of the function over a defined interval.</p>
